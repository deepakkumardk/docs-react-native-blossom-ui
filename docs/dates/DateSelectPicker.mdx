# DateSelectPicker

A DateSelectPicker component that provides day, month, and year selection using a popover interface.  
It can also be used as standalone Month or Year pickers or combined for a compact Month-Year picker.

import {
  BlossomUIRenderer,
  PropsTable,
  DateSelectPickerUsage,
  MonthPickerUsage,
  BlossomComponentPlayground,
} from "@site/src/components";

## Usage

<BlossomUIRenderer
  componentName={"DateSelectPickerUsage"}
  children={<DateSelectPickerUsage />}
  fileName={"DateSelectPicker"}
/>

## Month Picker

Use the `MonthPicker` component to select months independently.

<BlossomUIRenderer
  componentName={"MonthPickerUsage"}
  children={<MonthPickerUsage />}
  fileName={"DateSelectPicker"}
/>

## Year Picker

Display a standalone year selection using `YearPicker`.

```tsx
<View>
  <YearPicker />
</View>
```

## Month-Year picker

Combine both `MonthPicker` and `YearPicker` in a row layout for a compact selection interface.

```tsx
<View row>
  <MonthPicker />
  <YearPicker />
</View>
```

## Props

<PropsTable componentName="DateSelectPicker" />
