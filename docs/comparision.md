# Comparison

Blossom-UI is made keeping the design system, Customizability & developer experience in mind, so that it can help the app ship faster with an Awesome UI.

Following are the comparisons of the blossom-ui with the top react-native libraries -

## vs React-Native-Paper

[React-Native-Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com/) is a great community-driven library and it follows the Material Design for both the platforms Android & iOS.
Following are the few advantages you get on the Blossom-UI over the react-native-paper -

- You get more components **(30+ as of now)** than the react-native-paper
- A few examples are - **Select, MultiSelect, DatePicker, Calendar etc.**
- You get a **customized design system** instead of the forced material design, which you can also change based on the platform
- It also supports the **web platform** and you can also see it in real action on the each component documentation also

## vs UI-Kitten

[UI-Kitten](https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten/) has been a great library, and this library has taken a few inspirations also like the theme system inspired from it & a few more customization on top of it. But now the state of the library has been changed and we don't see any active development more.

- You get more components (30+ as of now) than the UI-Kitten
- A few extra components from the UI-Kitten like **Chip, OtpInput, ShimmerView etc.**

## vs React-Native Elements

Again [React-Native Elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/) is a great library and it also contains a lot of components, but it also lags on some basic and advanced components.
Following are the few advantages you get on the Blossom-UI over the react-native elements -

- You get more components **(30+ as of now)** than the react-native elements
  A few examples are - **Select, MultiSelect, DatePicker, Calendar etc.**
