## vs React Native Paper

[React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com/) is a mature, community-driven library that implements Google’s **Material Design** guidelines for Android and iOS.  
While it’s an excellent choice for Material-based apps, **Blossom UI** focuses on flexibility and a design-system-first approach.

### Why Blossom UI stands out:

- Offers **32+ production-ready components**, exceeding Paper’s set of essentials.
- Includes advanced components like **Select**, **MultiSelect**, **DatePicker**, and **Calendar**.
- Provides a **custom design system** — not limited to Material Design — allowing you to tailor the look and feel for each platform.

## vs UI Kitten

[UI Kitten](https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten/) has been an inspiration to Blossom UI — especially in terms of theming and customization.  
However, UI Kitten’s active development has slowed down, while Blossom UI continues to evolve with modern features and best practices.

### Why Blossom UI stands out:

- Delivers **more than 32 components**, going beyond Kitten’s core offering.
- Adds unique components such as **Chip**, **OtpInput**, **ShimmerView**, and more.
- Extends the theme system for finer control and easier scalability.

## vs React Native Elements

[React Native Elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/) provides a great base for building cross-platform apps.  
Blossom-UI builds upon that foundation by providing a more extensive set of components and a deeply customizable design system.

### Why Blossom UI stands out:

- Ships with **32+ components**, covering both foundational and advanced needs.  
  Examples include **Select**, **MultiSelect**, **DatePicker**, and **Calendar**.
- Features a **comprehensive design system**, offering **9 primary shades** and **5 semantic shades** per color — unlike Elements, which supports only a single shade per color.
- Encourages full **theme consistency** across apps, ensuring better scalability and maintainability.

In essence, **Blossom UI** combines the best of existing design libraries with a flexible, theme-first approach — empowering developers to build **beautiful, consistent, and scalable mobile and web experiences**.
